## Notes

- Islamic holidays **Eid al-Fitr** and **Eid al-Adha** are listed without specific dates because the Philippine government issues separate proclamations once the lunar dates are confirmed.
- This calendar focuses on **nationwide** regular and special non-working holidays. Local city/municipal holidays (e.g., foundation days) are **not included** here and may vary by locality.
