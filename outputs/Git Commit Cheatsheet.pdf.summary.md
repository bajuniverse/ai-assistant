**When to Use Each Type**

* Use `feat` when adding new functionality
* Use `fix` when solving a problem or bug
* Use `docs` when updating explanations or documentation
* Use `style` when making code look or format changes
* Use `refactor` when rewriting code for clarity or efficiency
* Use `test` when writing or updating tests
* Use `chore` when performing routine updates or maintenance tasks
* Use `perf` when optimizing code to make it faster or lighter
* Use `build` when changing how the project is built or packaged

**Additional Commit Types**

* `revert`: Undo a previous commit that broke something
* `BREAKING CHANGE`: A change that forces others to adjust their code
* `merge`: Merge branches (e.g., combine dev into main)
* `hotfix`: Urgent fix in production
* `security`: Fix vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, password leaks)
* `ui`: Changes to look and feel (not logic)
* `ux`: Improve user experience (e.g., simplify signup flow)
* `env`: Environment configuration changes (e.g., add staging config)
* `db`: Database changes (e.g., add users table)
* `deps`: Dependency changes (e.g., bump lodash to v4.17.21)

* `infra`: Infrastructure changes (e.g., update docker-compose)

**Practical Tips**

* Use present tense when writing commit messages (e.g. "add feature" instead of "added feature")
* Keep title short, 50 characters or less
* Add details to body if needed, especially for complex commits
* Commit messages should be clear and concise enough that future you (or teammate) won't be confused
