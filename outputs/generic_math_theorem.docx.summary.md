Here are the key points summarized in clear bullet points:

• The Generic Continuity Bound theorem states that a function f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous on ℝ if:
	+ For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |x - y| < δ implies |f(x) - f(y)| < ε
• This condition holds for all real numbers x ∈ ℝ
• The theorem implies that f is continuous at every point x ∈ ℝ
• Therefore, f is continuous on ℝ
