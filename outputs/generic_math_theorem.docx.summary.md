Here are the key points summarized in clear bullet points:

• A function f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous on ℝ if:
	+ For every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that:
		- |x - y| < δ implies |f(x) - f(y)| < ε
• The condition must hold for all real numbers (x, y).
• If the condition holds, then:
	+ f is continuous at every point x ∈ ℝ
	+ Therefore, f is continuous on ℝ
